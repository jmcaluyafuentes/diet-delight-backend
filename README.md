## R1: Website Desciption

### Description

Diet Delight is a modern web application designed to enhance the services of Fit Life Gym by offering additional value to its members by providing personalized meal planning and healthy eating guidance. Gym instructors need a tool to help gym members select meals that complement their fitness goals, such as muscle gain, weight loss, or improved endurance.

### Functionality and Features

1. Search Recipes (MVP 1) - The app allows users to search for recipes by selecting dietary categories aligned with their fitness goals (e.g., high-protein for muscle gain, low-carb for weight loss).

2. Print Recipes (MVP 2) - Users can select and print recipes in PDF format, which provides a handy grocery list, or save the file for easy access.

3. Featured Recipes (MVP 3) - The app provides access to a curated list of recommended recipes that allows users to explore and choose appealing options.

4. User Management (Stretch 1) - Users can create their accounts. Registered users can log in, update their profiles and delete their accounts if needed.

5. Save Recipes (Stretch 2) - Registered users can save their favorite recipes for easy retrieval. They can also add or remove recipes from their saved list.

### Reason why Stretch 1 and 2 are not yet implemented

Our current focus is on developing a robust Minimum Viable Product (MVP) that delivers the core functionalities of Diet Delight. This includes ensuring that key features, such as dietary category search and recipe printing, are working seamlessly and providing value to our users.

As part of this focus, we are prioritizing the identification and resolution of any bugs and refactoring components to make the app more reusable and easier to maintain. This foundational work is essential to ensure a smooth and reliable user experience.

While Stretch 1 (User Management) and Stretch 2 (Save Recipes) have not yet been implemented, these features remain a priority for our team. We are committed to continue the development even after the course concludes, as we believe this app can be a valuable tool in our own healthy lifestyle journeys, as well as those of our family and friends. As the app evolves, we will enhance its capabilities, making it an even more powerful resource for meal planning and healthy eating.

## R3: Application Architecture Diagram

![Application Architecture Diagram](./docs/architechture.png)

The frontend of the application renders the user interface and handles user interactions. Users can search for recipes, view detailed recipe information and select recipes to print. The frontend sends HTTP requests to the backend server to process user requests and retrieves the data.

The backend communicates with the Edamam API to fetch recipe data when users search for recipes. The API request includes parameters such as dietary categories and the response is processed by the backend before being sent to the front-end.

The backend temporarily saves recipe data retrieved from the third-party Edamam API in the database. This approach is useful to allow for quick access without repeatedly querying the external API. To comply with Edamam’s policy against permanent storage of recipe data, we use MongoDB’s Time-To-Live (TTL) feature to automatically delete the data after 10 minutes.

## Production Test

### Introduction

This provides a summary of the production testing conducted for the Diet Delight App, aimed to evalluate usability, functionality, and performance to ensure the app meets user needs and Fit Life Gym's requirements.

### Testing Results

### 1. Dietary Category Search

- Objective: Ensure users can search for recipes based on dietary categories.
- Result: Partially Passed
- Issues: The Render cloud server experienced a spin-down due to inactivity after a few minutes, causing delays in retrieving search results.
- Action: Manually access the Render cloud server shortly before testing sessions to ensure it is "spinned up" and ready to handle user requests.

### 2. Recipe Details View

- Objective: Verify clarity and comprehensiveness of recipe details.
- Result: Passed
- Issues: None
- Action: No action required
- Note: Cooking instructions are not provided directly by Edamam due to copyright restrictions. Instead, we include a link to the original recipe source where users can access the complete cooking instructions.

### 3. Recipe Printing in PDF Format

- Objective: Test PDF printing functionality.
- Result: Passed
- Issues: None
- Action: No action required
- Note: The PDF file was successfully generated and downloaded. The printed document includes the recipe details and a handy grocery list.

### 4. Featured Recipes

- Objective: Ensure users can access and view featured recipes.
- Result: Passed
- Issues: None
- Action: No action required
- Note: Featured recipes were displayed correctly, with links leading to full recipe details. The feature is functioning as intended, providing users with a curated list of recommended recipes. The recipes shuffle randomly at set time intervals, and the shuffling stops if the user adds a recipe to their print list.

### 5. Mobile Accessibility

- Objective: Ensure app usability on mobile devices.
- Result: Passed with Minor Issues
- Issues: Small touch targets leading to navigation difficulties.
- Action: Increase touch target size for improved usability.

## Client Feedback

- Positive feedback on app functionality and design.
- Suggestions for additional dietary categories and custom meal planning features.

## Summary of Findings

- Successes: Core features like recipe search and PDF printing performed well.
- Areas for Improvement: Performance optimization and mobile usability enhancements are needed.
- Next Steps: Implement performance improvements, refine the UI for mobile, and develop the strech features for user and recipe management.

## Conclusion

The Diet Delight App meets core objectives but requires optimization for enhanced user experience, especially on mobile devices. The development team will focus on performance improvements and expanding the app’s features in future updates.
